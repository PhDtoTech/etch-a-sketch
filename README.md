The Odin Project - Foundation Course

# Goals
Build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Steps to make it happen:
  1. Create a webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs.
  2. Set up hover effect so square divs change color when mouse passes over them.
  3. Add button to ask user for number of squares per side for grid.
  4. Change hover effect so square divs change color to a random RGB value.
  5. Change hover effect so each pass adds 10% of black to square divs color.

# Self-check
- [ ] Create square divs using JavaScript.
- [ ] Put grid squares inside another “container” div.
- [ ] Try different ways to make divs appear as a grid.
    - [ ] float/clear
    - [ ] inline-block
    - [ ] flexbox
    - [ ] CSS Grid
- [ ] Set up event listeners for when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it as a starting point for hovering effect.
- [ ] Try multiple ways to change the color of the divs.
    - [ ] add a new class to the div.
    - [ ] change the div’s background color using JavaScript.
- [ ] Create a brand new grid when user inputs a number without changing the total amount of pixels used.
